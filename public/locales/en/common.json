  "feedback-1": "Learning from Dr Robert has been one of the highlights of my time at University. For every class, Robert had such an infectious enthusiasm which engaged every member of the class for the duration of the whole class. Robert's insightful real world experiences also added a special extra dimension to the course, making it much more interesting. Every week it was clear that Robert was passionate about teaching and passionate about helping us succeed not only within the course, but also beyond. Teachers such as Dr Robert are few and far in between.<br/>-Hayasa",
